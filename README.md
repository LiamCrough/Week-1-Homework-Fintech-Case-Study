## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

    Borrowell Incorporated

* When was the company incorporated?

    2014

* Who are the founders of the company?

    Eva Wong and Andrew Grahah.

    Eva completed her tertiary education at Harvard and she leads the Product, Engineering, Design and Data teams and is a member of the Executive Team of Borrowell. 
    
    Andrew Graham similarly went to Harvard business school and co-founded the corporation nearly 10 years after graduation.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    Early notions of the business came about after analysing the growth of Artificial intelligence. This firm utilises AI to provide credit scores and loans to firms. Both founders have been quoted saying that the credit industry
    was in need of an upgrade and to evolve with the times and growing technology.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Company largely funded from private placements and venture capital/private equity firms. Utilises debt to an extent but majorly equity funded. Has 20 investors currently with total funding amounting to $72.2m


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

    An exorbinant amount of debt for every day Canadians. As per an article written by the financial post "Canadians have a debt problem, no doubt about it, but they probably owe more than they should, given the interest rates of 20% or more that they pay on their credit cards. Canadian households owed $1.9 trillion in personal debt as of January 2016". Utilising the power of AI, this firm aims to reduce the amount of interest paid on credit cards by offering individuals and firms highly accurate credit scores. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

    This firm aims their service towards everyday Canadians with ther service passing 1,000,000 users as of late 2019. People can take out personal loans of up to $35,000 in a matter of minutes online. Not only that, Borrowell is the first and one of few Canadian businesses that will check your credit scores for free without affecting your rating. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Using their newly found innovations in artificial intelligence technology to predict credit ratings, they are able to give out loans with more confidence than the major banks about the likelihood of the customer paying back said loan. This firm also allows all users to view their credit score, allowing the customer to review their credit risk and actively work towards making improvements. Furthermore, this firm utilises online lending which can be seen as faster and more convenient that traditional bank lending. Thus, attracting customers due to its accuracy and ease of use. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    This Fintech firm is utilising AI to predict credit scores as well as relay this information onto the customer. The mobile app available to customers is known as "Credit Coach" and provides three key features. The first is credit score comparison, which allows users to see where their own scores fall with the rest of Canada. The second notification feature offers important credit updates like new credit inquiry alerts and missed payment warnings, as well as messages to inform users when they are making good financial decisions. Finally, the Credit Coach tool provides helpful tips for Canadians to improve their credit scores. Users will also be able to see product recommendations that can help them address areas of improvement.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Credit/lending (Banking Services).

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    There are many online lenders in Canada, however, most of the popular firms only offer short term loans of much smaller amounts. The only firm that comes close to Borrowell in terms of loan amounts is Fairstone which offers loans up to $30,000. Similarly, these firms have quite large interest rates on their loans, with some reaching up to 48%. Notable rival firms include Mogo, SkyCap Financial, Eastern Loans and Lend Direct.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    As stated previously, this firm has reached over 1,000,000 users as of 2019, this marks a one in every 25 adults in Canada using this platform. Accordingly, this makes Borrowell Canada's largest Fintech firm by way of users. Similarly, Borrowell is estimated annual revenue is currently at approximately $8 million per year.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    Whilst Borrowell may not be generating the most income from online neding, its smart AI powered credit score generator has shielded the firm from certain riskier loans. This is the largest Fintech firm in Canada by way of users, 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    In the eyes of a customer, online lending may be seen as a potential risk or potentially unwise. This is due to banks holding a monopoly on this kind of business for most of known history. 
    Personally, I think that it would be wise to encorporate into the business a set of guarantees/assurances that their online lending scheme is not subject to severe interest rate changes or any other risks. The primary barrier that this firm is facing is decades of stigma surrounding alternative financing with similar firms having a track record of poor business practice. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    Similarly, using an AI chat bot to communicate with customers and assure them of the low risk nature of the firms activities would be beneficial to the firm. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
